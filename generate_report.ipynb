    "This project investigates the factors contributing to a Pokémon's perceived \"strength\" by examining its statistics, types, and generational origin. Pokémon is a widely popular game featuring creatures known as Pokémon, which engage in combat utilizing various elemental types such as Fire, Water, and Electric. Each Pokémon is defined by six primary statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HP** (Hit Points) – durability against damage\n",
    "- **Attack** – offensive capability with physical attacks\n",
    "- **Defense** – defensive capability against physical attacks\n",
    "- **Sp. Atk** – offensive capability with special attacks\n",
    "- **Sp. Def** – defensive capability against special attacks\n",
    "- **Speed** – determines action order in combat\n",
    "    The sum of these six statistics constitutes a Pokémon’s **Base Stat Total (BST)**, which is commonly employed as a metric for assessing overall capability.\n",
    "    There are currently **9 generations** of Pokémon, each introducing new creatures, types, and mechanics. This analysis aims to address questions such as:\n",
    "- Which Pokémon exhibit the highest statistical potential?\n",
    "- Which type exhibits the most effective offensive capability (inflicts the highest amount of super-effective damage)?\n",
    "- How do different types and generations compare in terms of potential strength?\n",
    "    Visualizations and statistical methods are utilized to uncover patterns and insights across a comprehensive dataset of Pokémon."

    "## Analyzing Pokémon by Type\n",
    "Pokémon are assigned elemental types, frequently possessing two types concurrently, referred to as a type combination. Type assignments dictate resistances and vulnerabilities; for instance, Fire-type Pokémon are susceptible to increased damage from Water-type attacks, whereas Grass-type Pokémon exhibit resistance to them. Type effectiveness modifiers also interact. Consequently, a Pokémon possessing both Grass and Fire typing would receive standard damage from Water-type attacks. A Type weakness results in a damage multiplier of two times the standard amount, while resistance reduces damage to half. Mutual weakness across both types yields a quadruple damage multiplier, whereas mutual resistance results in one-fourth the standard damage."

The Ice type stands out as a prime example, possessing significant offensive strength against Ground, Flying, and Dragon types. A key characteristic of these three types is their limited number of weaknesses; each possesses only three. Notably, the Ice type represents a unique intersection, being the sole shared weakness among Ground, Flying, and Dragon. However, beyond these specific type interactions, the data presented below clearly illustrates the substantial number of Pokémon across the board that are susceptible to Ice-type attacks:"

However, Dragon-type attacks are super effective against only 67 Pokémon, placing them in the seventeenth position in terms of super-effective targets, alongside the Normal type, which cannot deal super-effective damage to any type.

Given its strong second-place ranking in average BST and its status as one of the most resilient defensive types, it can be argued that the Steel type is the generally best type overall, primarily due to its exceptional defensive profile and robust statistical average.

This finding is consistent with common understanding, as types frequently associated with high speed include Electric, Flying, Dragon, and Fighting. The average speeds among these faster types show a relatively narrow range; the fourth fastest type, Fighting, averages only 8 points less than the Electric type. Conversely, Rock types recorded the lowest average Speed, at 59, which also aligns with common perceptions of their typical mobility. This average for Rock types is notably lower than that of the fourth slowest type, Grass, showing a significant difference of 12 points, indicating that Rock types are the slowest on average by a considerable margin."

    "## What type is the bulkiest\n",
    "To determine which type is the \"bulkiest,\" we must consider several factors related to a Pokémon's defensive capabilities. Pokémon possess three primary defensive statistics: Hit Points (HP), Defense (DEF), and Special Defense (SPD).While calculating damage is a complex procedure involving multiple variables, a key distinction lies in the attack type. When a Pokémon is hit by a physical attack, its Defense stat is used in the calculation. Conversely, if the attacking move is special, the receiver's Special Defense stat is used instead.Hit Points, however, contribute equally to survivability regardless of the attack type. Given that a Pokémon must be able to withstand both physical and special attacks to be considered genuinely bulky, and for simplification in this analysis, a composite \"Bulk\" statistic will be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Bulk = HP+\\frac{DEF+SPD}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is employed because HP provides a universal defense, while the average of Defense and Special Defense provides a general measure of resilience against type-dependent attacks."

These actions are the fundamental means by which Pokémon interact, encompassing offensive attacks, status effects, and statistical modifications. As the primary tools of combat, moves are critically important to a Pokémon's strategic viability and determine its effectiveness in battle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table provides detailed attributes for each Pokémon move. The columns are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ID** A unique numerical identifier assigned to each distinct move entry in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Name** – The official name of the Pokémon move, presented as a character string.\n",
    "- **Accuracy** – The probability, typically expressed as a percentage or a value out of 100, that the move will successfully connect with the target during battle.\n",
    "- **PP** – Power Points. Represents the maximum number of times a specific move can be utilized before it is depleted.\n",
    "- **Priority** – A numerical value that determines the execution order of moves within a turn. Moves with higher priority values are generally - executed earlier than moves with lower or standard priority.\n",
    "- **Power** – Base Power (BP). A numerical value indicating the inherent strength of an offensive move, serving as a primary factor in its damage - calculation. Moves with a power of 0 typically have non-damaging effects.\n",
    "- **Damage_Class** – Categorizes the move based on how its damage is calculated or if it inflicts damage at all. Common values include 'Physical', - 'Special', and 'Status'.\n",
    "- **Type** – The elemental or thematic typing assigned to the move (e.g., Fire, Water, Grass, Normal). This type interacts with the target's typing - to determine damage effectiveness.\n",
    "- **Effect** – A descriptive text field detailing any secondary or additional effects the move may inflict, beyond its primary function (e.g., - inflicting a status condition, changing stats).\n",
    "- **Effect_Chance** – The probability, typically expressed as a percentage, that the secondary effect described in the 'Effect' column will occur - upon successful execution of the move. Applies only to moves with secondary effects.\n",
    "- **Target** – Specifies the intended recipient(s) or area of effect for the move (e.g., 'single target', 'all opponents', 'the user', 'all allies').\n",

    "Based on the preceding data, an examination of moves like Jet Punch and Water Gun reveals that both are Water-type attacks lacking additional effects. The primary distinction lies in their Base Power and Power Points (PP). Jet Punch possesses a Base Power of 70, notably 20 points higher than Water Gun's 50. The only apparent disadvantage for Jet Punch is its PP count of 15, which is 10 less than Water Gun's 25. However, when determining the optimal attacking move, the difference between 15 and 25 PP is often considered less critical, as a single move is rarely utilized this many times within a typical battle."
