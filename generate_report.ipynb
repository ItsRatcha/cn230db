    "This project investigates the factors contributing to a Pokémon's perceived \"strength\" by examining its statistics, types, and generational origin. Pokémon is a widely popular game featuring creatures known as Pokémon, which engage in combat utilizing various elemental types such as Fire, Water, and Electric. Each Pokémon is defined by six primary statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HP** (Hit Points) – durability against damage\n",
    "- **Attack** – offensive capability with physical attacks\n",
    "- **Defense** – defensive capability against physical attacks\n",

    "## Analyzing Pokémon by Type\n",
    "Pokémon are assigned elemental types, frequently possessing two types concurrently, referred to as a type combination. Type assignments dictate resistances and vulnerabilities; for instance, Fire-type Pokémon are susceptible to increased damage from Water-type attacks, whereas Grass-type Pokémon exhibit resistance to them. Type effectiveness modifiers also interact. Consequently, a Pokémon possessing both Grass and Fire typing would receive standard damage from Water-type attacks. A Type weakness results in a damage multiplier of two times the standard amount, while resistance reduces damage to half. Mutual weakness across both types yields a quadruple damage multiplier, whereas mutual resistance results in one-fourth the standard damage."

    "Certain Pokémon types are considered to possess superior offensive capabilities compared to others. The Ice type stands out as a prime example, possessing significant offensive strength against Ground, Flying, and Dragon types. A key characteristic of these three types is their limited number of weaknesses; each possesses only three. Notably, the Ice type represents a unique intersection, being the sole shared weakness among Ground, Flying, and Dragon. However, beyond these specific type interactions, the data presented below clearly illustrates the substantial number of Pokémon across the board that are susceptible to Ice-type attacks:"

    "Based on the data presented above, the Dragon type appears to be the strongest based on average BST, boasting a mean BST of 504. This figure surpasses that of Steel, which ranks second, by a margin of 20 points. However, Dragon-type attacks are super effective against only 67 Pokémon, placing them in the seventeenth position in terms of super-effective targets, alongside the Normal type, which cannot deal super-effective damage to any type. Consequently, the strength of the Dragon type appears to be primarily attributed to its statistical profile rather than its offensive type effectiveness.\n",

    "For those wondering why moves typing affect the process of ranking, the Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) is a mechanic that grants a 1.5x damage multiplier when a Pokémon uses an attack that matches its own type. This bonus represents a significant factor in overall damage calculation.\n",

    "The Steel type, occupying the second position in terms of average BST, while Steel-type attacks are super effective against approximately 140 Pokémon, is widely regarded as one of the premier defensive types. It possesses a notable 10 resistances (Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Dragon, Fairy, and Steel), while being susceptible to only three types: Fire, Fighting, and Ground. Given its strong second-place ranking in average BST and its status as one of the most resilient defensive types, it can be argued that the Steel type is the generally best type overall, primarily due to its exceptional defensive profile and robust statistical average. The Dragon type follows closely in second place, distinguished by its impressive statistical base."

    "In this instance, the average Base Stat Total (BST) ranking aligns with other indicators to identify the generally weakest type. The Bug type exhibits the lowest average BST at 374, standing as the sole type below the 400 threshold. Furthermore, Bug-type attacks demonstrate limited offensive efficacy: they deal reduced damage (0.5x) to a significant 7 types (Fire, Fighting, Poison, Flying, Ghost, Steel, and Fairy), while being super effective (2x) against only 3 types. The combination of its low average statistical profile and poor offensive type coverage strongly positions the Bug type as the weakest overall."

    "## Determining the Strongest/Weakest Pokémon Generation\n",
    "Unlike some previous findings, the identification of the generation containing the strongest or weakest Pokémon can be readily determined by utilizing the average Base Stat Total (BST) metric. For the purpose of this analysis, Pokémon are assigned to the generation in which they first appeared. This methodology counts Pokémon debuting in a particular generation under that generation, even if they reappear in subsequent titles. While move pools may evolve and spread across generations, focusing on the average BST provides a consistent measure of the statistical baseline introduced by each generation."
